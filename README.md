## Description

This ecommerce app has basic functionalities such as sorting products by categories and viewing product details. On the details page, you can read more information about the product and also add-to-cart. The sticky nav bar only consists of the Home link and Cart link, where the cart keeps a counter of number of types of products that are already added-to-cart. On the cart page, you can view the current cart items and adjust quantity, where the total price shown will increase automatically. Reducing quantity to less than 1 will remove the whole item. Contact & shipping details section is a controlled form, where upon filling up and clicking submit, these details will be shown on the pop-up summary. Payment methods are not yet integrated.
